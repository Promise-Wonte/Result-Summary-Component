## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned
 I learned that it is totally unneccessary to declare height on the content box after declaring box-sizing while styling. Declaring height will only cause elements to overflow. You can achieve your desired content box height by using your paddings and other related css properties to adjust your the content box while styling.

Again, CSS flexbox is makes makes styling very easy.

### Continued development

i am getting moe familiar with stylesheet but i am looking forward to learning more item placement. the rifht css properties to use hat will make my work very easy. CSS gradients, transforms and transition aRe some of the css properties i want to focus more on and ofcourse, its responsiveness.
